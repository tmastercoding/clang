## **NYPC 2022 Practice Question 01**

>Validate race record question\
>Used Python

```python
# Must print Yes if all records are valid
# And no if a record is invalid

# A record is invalid if:
# User starts a race before previous race has been finished
# User finishes a race  before starting a race
# Race takes under (excluding) 60 seconds
# If race does not finish

#### file format ####
# (number of players) (number of total logs)
# (time) (player number) (start(0) or finish(1))

# Pre process file
# Check if each record is valid
# Print outcome
